## Ideas for New Features to Implement

_If an idea of this list looks concrete enough and useful for the application, it should be transformed into an issue in the project's issues tracker and removed from this list._

* Show the planets at a specific time, support a "timelapse" animation.

* Add the "Kiddy" theme.

* Make objects selectable in the view, probably with additional text info.

* Transform the application into a component that can be easily integrated into a Web page. API to insert AstroCadre in a Web page.

* Possibility to add markers at any position in the viewport.

* Star colors depending on their class/temperature (in a dedicated theme?)
