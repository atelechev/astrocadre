### Ideas for New Features to Implement

* Show the planets at a specific time, support a "timelapse" animation.

* Add the "Kiddy" theme.

* Make objects selectable in the view, probably with additional text info.

* Transform the application into a component that can be easily integrated into a Web page. API to insert AstroCadre in a Web page.

* Possibility to add markers at any position in the viewport

* Star colors depending on their class/temperature (in a dedicated theme?)
