## Notes about this app development

Started on 2018-04-15.

### Project Set-Up

Followed the guidelines from Pluralsight "Building a JavaScript Development Environment" course.

_Initial set-up:_

  * .editorconfig

  * npm

  * Express as dev server

  * localtunnel to share the app externally

  * nsp security checks also enabled, but with default config only

To start the app:

    npm start

### April 17th, 2018

* The project is now using Angular & TypeScript. I postponed the idea of plugging all the stuff recommended in the Pluralsight course. The primary objective is to render a simple POC before wrapping it in all other stuff.

* ThreeJS is used as 3D rendering lib. A simple animation is implemented to check how it works with Angular & TypeScript. The dedicated branch is `setup-threejs`, it might be reused for other experiences as quick starter project.


### Next Steps

SV-1 - Initial step for a scrollable sky view:
  * wireframe of the sky sphere parallels and meridians
  * the viewport is placed in the center
  * the view if fully scrollable in all directions
